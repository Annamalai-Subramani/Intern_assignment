However, they require vast amounts of training data, which can be a hindrance for resource-constrained applications.\n",

This approach, known as knowledge-distilled transformers, has shown promising results in reducing the computational costs associated with NLP tasks while maintaining high performance.\n",

            "Knowledge-distilled transformers offer several advantages. They require less training data, making them suitable for scenarios where data is limited. Additionally, they are faster to train and deploy, enabling real-time NLP applications. Furthermore, knowledge distillation allows for customization, where domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated to enhance the model's performance on specific tasks.\n",
